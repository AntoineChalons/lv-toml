LV-TOML
=================

LV-TOML is an open source LabVIEW library for parsing and composing [TOML v0.4.0 files](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).

LV-TOML is tested against the TOML test suite [toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test).

About this fork
------------

The original developer is not maintaining this project, so this fork was created to update to a newer version of LabVIEW and add some features.
A discussion was created on LAVA forum to discuss this : https://lavag.org/topic/21972-anyone-using-toml-files/

Installation
------------

[The most recent VI Package (.vip) can be downloaded here.](https://github.com/erdosmiller/lv-toml/releases)

Open the VI Package using [VI Package Manager](http://vipm.jki.net/) and press ***Install***.

In LabVIEW, The LV-TOML palette can be found in the ***Erdos Miller*** palette.

Usage
-----

The polymorphic VIs ***Read TOML File.vi*** and ***Write TOML File.vi*** can parse and compose TOML files to and from a variant or a ***TOML Value.ctl***. ***TOML Value.ctl*** values are composable and caseable using [LV-Tagged-Union](https://github.com/erdosmiller/lv-tagged-union). To use LV-Tagged-Union with this library, the types LV-TOML:TOML Value.ctl and LV-TOML:TOML Key-Value Pair.ctl from the TOML palette must be in memory.

Dependencies
------------

OpenG Toolkit

MGI Tools

[LV-JSON](https://github.com/erdosmiller/lv-json) (only for needed for running tests)

Requires LabVIEW 2017 or later
